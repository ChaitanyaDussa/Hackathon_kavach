Side A: The Encryption Workflow (The Sender)
Goal: Turn your text file into a hidden image.

Prepare the "Prompt"

You create a file named prompts.txt.

Content: This contains your sensitive data (e.g., "The launch code is 8841").

Select Cover Image

You choose a normal, harmless image (e.g., landscape.jpg).

This is called the "Cover Image."

Lock it (AES Encryption)

You enter a Password in the app.

The app takes the text from prompts.txt, mixes it with a "Salt" (random data), and encrypts it using the AES-256 standard.

Result: The text becomes unreadable gibberish (Ciphertext).

Hide it (LSB Encoding)

The app takes that gibberish and breaks it down into 0s and 1s (binary).

It modifies the Least Significant Bit (the smallest detail) of the image pixels to match your data.

Visual: The image looks exactly the same to the human eye.

Output

The app generates a new file: secure.png.

You send this image to the receiver via email, WhatsApp, or Slack.

Side B: The Decryption Workflow (The Receiver)
Goal: Extract the text back out of the image.

Receive the File

The receiver downloads secure.png.

Upload to App

They open Project KAVACH and go to Tab 2 (Decrypt).

They upload secure.png.

Unlock (Authentication)

They must enter the exact Password you used in Side A.

Note: If the password is wrong, the math won't work, and they get nothing.

Extract (LSB Decoding)

The app scans the pixels of the image.

It pulls out the hidden 0s and 1s from the pixel data.

It reconstructs the "gibberish" (Ciphertext).

Decrypt (AES Decryption)

The app uses the password to decrypt the gibberish.

Final Output: The original text from prompts.txt appears on the screen: "The launch code is 8841".
