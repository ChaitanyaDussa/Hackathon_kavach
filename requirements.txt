Step 1: Create the File
Open your text editor (Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

Copy the exact text below.

Paste it into the new file.

Plaintext

streamlit
cryptography
Pillow
Save the file inside your project folder (where your app.py is located) with the exact name: requirements.txt

Step 2: How to Use It
Once the file is saved, open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux), navigate to your project folder, and run this command:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Why do you need this?
For GitHub: It lets other people run your code easily.

For Deployment: If you host this app online (like on Streamlit Cloud), the server looks for this file to know what to install.

Alternative Method (Command Line)
If you are already in your terminal inside the project folder, you can create it instantly by running this single command:

Windows (Command Prompt):

DOS

echo streamlit > requirements.txt & echo cryptography >> requirements.txt & echo Pillow >> requirements.txt
Mac/Linux/Git Bash:

Bash

echo -e "streamlit\ncryptography\nPillow" > requirements.txt
